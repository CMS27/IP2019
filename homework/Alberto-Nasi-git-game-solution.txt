Level 1

Clone git-game locally through a direct 'clone' command
'Git log' to check the commits history
Notice the commit called 'Hello world' (solution of the riddle) and the number next to it
'Git checkout [number]' and it will switch to that particular commit
Level 1 solved

Level 2 

Control the different branches with 'git branch -a'
Notice a branch called 'bug' (solution of the riddle)
'Git checkout bug'
Level 2 solved

Level 3

To check the contributors to a specific file 'git blame coop.cpp'
Notice that there are two contributors, one of them in LinusTorvalds2014 who inserted an infinite loop in the program
Checkout the branch called LinusTorvald2014
Level 3 solved

Level 4

Type 'ls -a' to view the hidden files of the directory
Open the file .gitignore
Level 4 solved

Level 5

Back to the list of branches
Checkout to the branch 'tree' (solution of the riddle)
Level 5 solved

Level 6

Run './outputclue.sh nextclue_input.cpp'
Level 6 solved

Level 7 

Try to merge the 'tree' branch with the 'code4life' branch. The command is 'git merge code4life' (while you're on the tree branch)
Git will put in evidence a conflict with the 'nextclue_input.cpp' file
Open 'nextclue_input.cpp' on a text editor (mine is Atom) and cancel the change made by the user (between <<<<< and ======), then add and commit
Run './outputclue.sh nextclue_input.cpp' again
Open the mouse branch
Level 7 solved

Level 8

Explore previous branches to find another 'remember' file.
Found it in 'bug'
Use the command diff to compare the two 'remember' file. The command is (while on the mouse branch) 'git diff mouse bug ./remember'
The output indicates that part of the differences between the two files point to a branch called 'Henry'
Level 8 solved

Level 9

Checkout to 'Henry' branch and notice through the 'tag' command that there is a tag named 'Henry'. It seems that the checkout command propritises tags instead of branches.
Try to rename the tag (could also delete, but don't really trust deleting without a backup on code I didn't write)
Therefore copy the tag with the command 'git tag Henry Henry1' (creates a new identical tag named Henry1)
Then delete the old tag with the command 'git tag -d Henry'
Checkout to 'Henry'
Level 9 solved

Level 10

Add a new upstream, type 'git remote add upstream https://github.com/drami025/git-game.git' 
Then sync the local repository with the upstream one.
Git fetch upstream and checkout to master
Then merge with 'upstream/master'
Level 10 solved
